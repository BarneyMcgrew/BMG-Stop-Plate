# BMG-Stop-Plate

The BMG Stop Plate (Barney McGrew Stop Plate) is a second generation iteration of the standard design of a stop plate and timer using a PIEZO sensor as the main device of detection. The stop plate is designed to take a hit from an Airsoft replica at up to 7 joules using a plastic BB as the projectile. This is a wired solution to ensure simplicity of design and adheres to the KISS (Keep It Stupid Simple) principles. The wiring is a standard RJ45 network cable which is robust and capable of distances up to 100 metres. The timer uses an Arduino Nano as its brain and has a number of basic features to assist with running competitions and training drills with this system.

This system is primarily designed for IPSC Action Air and adheres to the prescribed requirements of the rules.

## Development

The Stop Plate codebase is maintained and developed using Visual Studio Code and the PlatformIO plugin. Please ensure you have both the IDE and the plugin set up prior to checking out the codebase in this project.

## Features

- Record a par time after start when the stop plate is struck by a projectile.
- Adjust the sensitivity of the PIEZO sensor for different environments and projectile velocities.

## Installation
To install the firmware to your device, follow the instructions in the README.txt file included in the firmware version that you intend to install on your ardiuno device.
